## üìã Testing the Trading Company Workflow

### Test Documents Order

To properly test the intelligent workflow, upload documents in this specific order to see the complete business flow:

### **Scenario 1: Quotation ‚Üí PO ‚Üí Proforma Invoice Flow**

**Step 1: Upload Quotation Document**
- **Document Type**: Quotation from supplier
- **Expected AI Classification**: `quotation`
- **What Happens**: 
  - System creates new transaction
  - Extracts supplier and customer entities
  - Suggests: "Issue Purchase Order to confirm purchase from supplier"

**Step 2: Upload Purchase Order (PO)**
- **Document Type**: Purchase Order from trading company
- **Expected AI Classification**: `purchase_order`
- **What Happens**:
  - Links to existing transaction
  - Workflow advances to "po_issued" 
  - Suggests: "Wait for supplier to issue Proforma Invoice"

**Step 3: Upload Proforma Invoice**
- **Document Type**: Proforma Invoice from supplier (after PO)
- **Expected AI Classification**: `proforma_invoice`
- **What Happens**:
  - Links to existing transaction
  - Workflow advances to "proforma_received"
  - Suggests: "Make payment to supplier according to payment terms"

**Step 4: Upload Commercial Invoice**
- **Document Type**: Commercial/Tax Invoice from supplier
- **Expected AI Classification**: `commercial_invoice` or `tax_invoice`
- **What Happens**:
  - Links to existing transaction
  - Workflow advances to "invoice_received"
  - Suggests: "Upload packing list to complete transaction"

**Step 5: Upload Packing List**
- **Document Type**: Packing List from supplier
- **Expected AI Classification**: `packing_list`
- **What Happens**:
  - Links to existing transaction
  - Workflow completes ‚Üí status becomes "completed"
  - Shows transaction summary

### **Scenario 2: Proforma Invoice ‚Üí PO Flow** 

**Step 1: Upload Proforma Invoice First**
- **Document Type**: Proforma Invoice from supplier
- **Expected AI Classification**: `proforma_invoice`
- **What Happens**:
  - System creates new transaction
  - Suggests: "Issue Purchase Order to confirm purchase from supplier"

**Step 2: Upload Purchase Order**
- **Document Type**: Purchase Order from trading company
- **Expected AI Classification**: `purchase_order`
- **What Happens**:
  - Links to existing transaction
  - Workflow advances to "po_issued"
  - Suggests: "Make payment according to payment terms" (skips additional proforma step)

**Continue with Steps 4-5 from Scenario 1**
