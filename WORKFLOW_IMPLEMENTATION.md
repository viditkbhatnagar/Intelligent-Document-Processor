# Intelligent Trading Company Workflow System

## Overview

I've successfully integrated an intelligent workflow engine into your document processor that handles the complete trading company business flow. The system now automatically tracks document relationships, manages business transactions, and provides intelligent suggestions for next steps.

## New Business Flow Implementation

The system now handles the complete trading company workflow as you described:

### 1. Initial Supplier Communication
- **Quotation**: Supplier provides pricing via quotation document
- **Proforma Invoice**: Alternative to quotation - supplier provides pricing via proforma invoice

### 2. Purchase Confirmation
- **Purchase Order (PO/LPO)**: Trading company confirms purchase from supplier

### 3. Order Processing
- If supplier initially sent **quotation** â†’ supplier issues **proforma invoice** after PO
- If supplier initially sent **proforma invoice** â†’ proceed directly to payment

### 4. Payment Processing
- Trading company pays supplier (full/partial) based on payment terms in PO
- System tracks payment status and terms

### 5. Order Fulfillment
- Supplier prepares order for shipment
- System tracks order readiness

### 6. Final Documentation
- **Commercial/Tax Invoice**: Supplier issues invoice to trading company
